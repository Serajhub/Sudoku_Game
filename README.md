The project will primarily use Java language for coding.
Java Swing will also be used to build the GUI application.
Java Swing is a part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) which is used to create window-based applications.
AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) is the base for Java Swing.
Java Swing is used to build lightweight GUI applications.
Java Swing provides a lot of styling components such as buttons, labels, text fields, etc. for building the GUI.
JFrames are top-level containers provided by Java Swing which provide a playground for designing components.
JFrames are also known as base windows on which other components such as menu bars, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc. rely.
Almost every Java Swing application starts with the JFrame window.
